# Parallel Resistance
1. Calculates the overall resistance of resistors in parallel
    
## Expected Input & Output
    > parallel([330, 1000, 2200])
    > "222.973 ohms"

# Voltage Drop    
2. Calculates the voltage drops at each resistor


## Expected Input & Output
    > potential_divider(9, [3000, 1000])
    > "6.75v"
    > "2.25v"

# Temperature Check
3. Determines if the patient has hypothermia
